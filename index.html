<h1>Hello everyone!</h1>
<p> I am a little 'girl' who overcame the very difficult second time period of life </p>
<p> I asked myself so many times how it would be if I could come back to that time and change something which maybe make my thoughts now softer when thinking back about them</p>
<p> But it seems to be my life to be. And I need it to become robust and stronger in the future. </p>
<p> Now it is time for me and myself </p>
<p> One day all things come back to the right persons</p>
